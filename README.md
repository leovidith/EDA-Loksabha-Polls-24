# Agile Implementation Path for 2024 Election Results Analysis

## Overview:
This project involves analyzing and visualizing the results of the 2024 election using Python. The script processes election data to provide insights into party and candidate performance, margin of victory, and other key metrics that reveal trends across constituencies.

## Why Use Data Analytics for Election Results?
Data analytics allows us to:
- **Uncover insights** from election results that may not be immediately obvious through manual review.
- **Provide a comprehensive view** of electoral trends, party margins, and constituency performance.
- **Support decision-making** by offering accurate, data-driven analyses that highlight key areas of focus, like party dominance or candidate success.

## Agile Sprint Features:

### **Sprint 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**
- **Tasks**:
  - Load the `election_results_2024.csv` data file.
  - Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, data formatting).
- **Deliverable**: Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

### **Sprint 2: Margin and Seat Count Analysis**
- **Tasks**:
  - Calculate total margin of victory and number of constituencies won by each party.
  - Prepare data for visual representation.
- **Deliverable**: Calculated party margins and constituency counts.

### **Sprint 3: Candidate Comparison and Visualization**
- **Tasks**:
  - Compare the votes of key candidates (e.g., Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi, Amit Shah) across constituencies.
  - Generate visualizations like bar plots comparing candidates.
- **Deliverable**: Visualization showing candidate performance.

### **Sprint 4: NDA vs. INDI Party Analysis**
- **Tasks**:
  - Analyze and compare the constituencies won by NDA and INDI parties.
  - Visualize the comparison using bar plots.
- **Deliverable**: Visual representation of the NDA vs. INDI performance.

### **Sprint 5: Margin of Victory and Trailing Parties**
- **Tasks**:
  - Analyze the margin of victory and generate visualizations, including bar plots, histograms, and box plots.
  - Visualize the top 10 trailing parties by votes and seats.
- **Deliverable**: Visuals showcasing margin of victory and trailing party analysis.

### **Sprint 6: Deployment and Reporting**
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate all visualizations and analysis into a final report.
  - Provide user documentation explaining how to run the script and interpret results.
- **Deliverable**: Final report with visualizations and instructions.
